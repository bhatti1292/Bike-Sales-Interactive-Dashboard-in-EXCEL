# Bike Buyers Analysis and Dashboard Project
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of bike buyers to uncover trends and insights, and culminates in the creation of a comprehensive dashboard to visualize the data and support decision-making processes.

# Project Steps
## 1. Data Cleaning
The initial phase of the project involved cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included:

Removing duplicates and irrelevant data.
Standardizing categorical data for uniformity.

## 2. Feature Engineering
After cleaning the data, additional columns were created to enhance the analysis. Notably, an "Age Brackets" column was added using IF statements in Excel to categorize individuals into different age groups:

Adolescent (21-35 years)
Middle Age (36-50 years)
Old (51+ years)
## 3. Data Analysis with Pivot Tables
Pivot tables were utilized to summarize and analyze the data. Key analyses included:

Average income by gender and bike purchase status.
Distribution of bike purchases across different regions.
Relationship between marital status bike purchases.
## 4. Data Visualization
Various visualizations were created to represent the data insights effectively. These visualizations included:

Bar charts to show the distribution of bike purchases by gender and age brackets.
Line Graphs to illustrate the realtion of age and bike purchase.
Line graphs to display trends in commuted distance levels.
## 5. Dashboard Creation
An interactive dashboard was developed using the visualizations created. The dashboard allows users to:

Filter data by different categories such as gender, age bracket, region, and more.
View summarized statistics and trends at a glance.
Interact with the data through slicers and dynamic charts.
# Tools and Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot table creation, and visualizations.
Excel Formulas: Specifically, IF statements for creating new columns.
Pivot Tables: For summarizing and analyzing data.
Dashboard Features: Including slicers and interactive elements for dynamic data visualization.
Insights and Findings
The analysis provided valuable insights into the demographics and behaviors of bike buyers:

Income levels and their influence on bike purchases.
The impact of marital status on buying decisions.
Regional preferences and trends in bike buying.
# Conclusion
This project showcases the power of Excel in data analysis and visualization. The interactive dashboard created serves as a powerful tool for understanding the factors influencing bike purchases and can aid in strategic decision-making for marketing and sales.
