Bike Buyers Analysis and Dashboard Project
Project Overview
This project involved analyzing a dataset of bike buyers to uncover trends and insights, and culminated in the creation of a comprehensive dashboard to visualize the data and support decision-making processes.

Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning
The initial phase of the project involved cleaning the dataset to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data. This included:

Removing duplicates and irrelevant data.
Handling missing values appropriately.
Standardizing categorical data for uniformity.
2. Feature Engineering
After cleaning the data, I created additional columns to enhance the analysis. Notably, I added an "Age Brackets" column using IF statements in Excel to categorize individuals into different age groups:

Youth (0-20 years)
Young Adult (21-35 years)
Middle Age (36-50 years)
Senior (51+ years)
3. Data Analysis with Pivot Tables
Next, I utilized pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data. Key analyses included:

Average income by gender and bike purchase status.
Distribution of bike purchases across different regions.
Relationship between marital status, number of children, and bike purchases.
4. Data Visualization
I created various visualizations to represent the data insights effectively. These visualizations included:

Bar charts to show the distribution of bike purchases by gender and age brackets.
Pie charts to illustrate the proportion of bike buyers across different regions.
Line graphs to display trends in income levels in relation to bike purchases.
5. Dashboard Creation
The final step was to develop an interactive dashboard using the visualizations created. The dashboard allows users to:

Filter data by different categories such as gender, age bracket, region, and more.
View summarized statistics and trends at a glance.
Interact with the data through slicers and dynamic charts.
Tools and Technologies Used
Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, feature engineering, pivot table creation, and visualizations.
Excel Formulas: Specifically, IF statements for creating new columns.
Pivot Tables: For summarizing and analyzing data.
Dashboard Features: Including slicers and interactive elements for dynamic data visualization.
Insights and Findings
The analysis provided valuable insights into the demographics and behaviors of bike buyers:

Income levels and their influence on bike purchases.
The impact of marital status and number of children on buying decisions.
Regional preferences and trends in bike buying.
Conclusion
This project showcases the power of Excel in data analysis and visualization. The interactive dashboard created serves as a powerful tool for understanding the factors influencing bike purchases and can aid in strategic decision-making for marketing and sales.
